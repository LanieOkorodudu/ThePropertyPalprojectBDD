# My Personal PropertyPalProject

## Overview
I created this project out of personal interest and my love for automating tasks. This project showcases my skills in Java, Selenium, BDD, and TDD frameworks, 
and my proficiency with the Eclipse IDE. It demonstrates how automation can streamline processes, improve efficiency, and enhance the reliability of software testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Frameworks**:
  - **Selenium**: Used for browser automation and testing.
  - **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**: Utilized BDD frameworks such as Cucumber for writing human-readable tests.
  - **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Followed TDD principles for writing tests before code implementation.
- **IDE**: Eclipse IDE

## Java and Selenium
This project leverages Java along with Selenium for browser automation. Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation tasks.

### Key Features:
- Automated browser interactions.
- Functional testing of web applications.
- Cross-browser testing.

## BDD Framework
Implemented BDD using Cucumber to ensure that the specifications are understandable by all stakeholders, including non-technical members.

### Key Features:
- Write tests in a human-readable format.
- Ensure alignment with business requirements.
- Facilitate collaboration between developers, testers, and business analysts.

## TDD Framework
Applied TDD to ensure that tests are written before the actual code, leading to better-designed, cleaner, and more reliable code.

### Key Features:
- Write tests first, then code.
- Immediate feedback on code changes.
- Improved code quality and design.

## Eclipse IDE
Used Eclipse IDE for Java development and running automated tests. Eclipse provides robust tools and features for Java development.

### Key Features:
- Code editing and debugging.
- Integrated build tools.
- Plugin support for various frameworks and languages.
  
### Prerequisites
- Java JDK
- Eclipse IDE
- Selenium WebDriver
- Cucumber (for BDD)
